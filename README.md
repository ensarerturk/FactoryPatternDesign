# FactoryPatternDesign

A simple Factory Pattern example that prints the recommended weapon after entering the weapon type and preferred shell type.

There are 2 different types of weapons: Pistol and SmoothboreRifles. You can choose one of them and proceed. If desired, the program can be exited with "Exit".

If a pistol is selected, 7.65mm and 9mm bullet types are requested. If you choose one of them, the recommended weapon will be printed on the screen. If SmoothboreRifles is selected, the 7.62mm 36cal bullet type will be assumed and the weapon recommendation will be printed on the screen accordingly.
